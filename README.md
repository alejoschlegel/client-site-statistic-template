# Task Result

## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- JavaScript
- React

I chose JavaScript because it includes all of the features of a programming language embedded in your web browser and is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web.
I chose React-Redux because it allows me to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. Allowing to make fast, scalable and simple applications.
